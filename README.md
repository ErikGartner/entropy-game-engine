# Entropy Game Engine
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErikGartner/game-ai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ErikGartner/game-ai)

*For every action, there is a reaction, and a Piker reaction is quite a fuckin' thing.* - Turkish in Snatch (2000)

The idea is to create an advanced ai engine that plans actions for characters
based on their goals, states, knowledge in a closed world.

## Design
Entropy's central concept is that characters are proactive agents that actively pursue some set of goals.
